netspray [-v] rx|tx IP [IP]*
 -b --bind ADDR  optional bind address
 -v              be verbose (also keeps process in foreground)
 -r --rate       packets per second [10]
 -p --port N     port number to use [1234]
 -l --loss N     packet loss trigger level [3]
 -R --rcount     recoverycount until recovered [200]
 -F              stay in foreground (no daemon)
 -e --exec PRG   run this program to handle events

Netspray has two modes: 'rx' and 'tx'

rx mode is the receiver mode.
The receiver will expect packets from the IP-addresses listed.
If sequential packet loss is detected the alarm function will trigger.

tx mode is the transmitter mode.
The transmitter will send packets to all IP-addresses listed at the given rate.

It is possible to bind to an adress that is not (yet) configured on the system.

Exec program:
The program/script given to the '-e' switch receives event information in argv.
 $1 = IP
 $2 = FAIL|RECONNECT|RECOVER
